****Known Bugs****

As of right now, the unit conversion does NOT work. I didn't fix it because there were other things that were more relevant.

Pressing the back arrow from settings causes the app to crash, again, not a major problem since you can use the back button on the device to go back.

if you ignore and change the PMV boundaries from -0.5 and 0.5 to -0.8 and 0.8, etc the values reset when you kill the app and start it again. Since I didn't add a way for you to physically adjust the limits I figured this was okay. That way if you press ignore by accident and change the limits, you just have to restart the app.

Sometimes the PMV gets calculated wrong, all you have to do is pull down to REFRESH. Once should work, but you can do it until the values look right.
